            You might be thinking that you introduce yourself to people all the time,
            so surely you don’t need a guide about it. However, there are ways that
            you can give a self-introduction to send across the right sort of message.
            Shuffling into a room and murmuring your name just loud enough to be
            audible is going to say something quite different than if you strode in
            with your hand outstretched and your shoulders back. Yes, body language
            plays a big part in introducing yourself too of course, but language
            itself is important in conveying the right sort of message to your
            audience too. First, we’ll take a look at what self-introduction is all
            about, before giving some tips that’ll help you introduce yourself more
            effectively.
